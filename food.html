        <h2>Dining Etiquette</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3><strong>Sharing is Caring:</strong></h3>
                <p>Korean meals are often shared family-style, with everyone taking food from common dishes.</p>
            <h3><strong>Use of Chopsticks and Spoons:</strong></h3>
                <p>Chopsticks are used for solid foods, while spoons are used for soups and rice. It’s customary to wait for the eldest to start eating before you begin.</p>
            <h3><strong>Drinking Etiquette:</strong></h3>
                <p>When drinking alcohol, it’s customary to pour drinks for others rather than yourself. Hold your glass with both hands when receiving a drink from someone older or of higher status.</p>
            <h3><strong>Respectful Behavior:</strong></h3>
                <p>Avoid sticking chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice, as it resembles a funeral ritual. Also, try not to point with your chopsticks or use them to gesture while talking.</p>
